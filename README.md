# catch-the-square
Simple game made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

When touched with the mouse arrow, the square gets faster or smaller.

Maximum level is 36, when the square is the smallest and fastest.

I did not stop the game there; the square may get even smaller or disappear, but I couldn't catch it anymore to confirm.
